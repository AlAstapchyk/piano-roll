# PianoRoll Frontend Task Challenge

### Part 1: Display

Implement an interface following the design similar to YouTube. There are two states need to implement:

#### Grid layout

```
+--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
|              |   |              |   |              |
|  Piano Roll  |   |  Piano Roll  |   |  Piano Roll  |
|              |   |              |   |              |
+--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
+--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
|              |   |              |   |              |
|  Piano Roll  |   |  Piano Roll  |   |  Piano Roll  |
|              |   |              |   |              |
+--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
+--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
|              |   |              |   |              |
|  Piano Roll  |   |  Piano Roll  |   |  Piano Roll  |
|              |   |              |   |              |
+--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
                          ...
```

#### Main View

```
+-----------------------------------+  +--------------+
|                                   |  |              |
|                                   |  |  Piano Roll  |
|                                   |  |              |
|        Main Piano Roll            |  +--------------+
|                                   |  +--------------+
|                                   |  |              |
|                                   |  |  Piano Roll  |
+-----------------------------------+  |              |
                                       +--------------+
                                             ...
```

Here are development tasks to build this interface:

1. **Implement Grid Layout**: Display the Piano Rolls in a responsive grid layout on the main page.
2. **Implement Interactive Selection**: Make each Piano Roll in the grid clickable. Upon clicking an item, it should become the main element on the page, enlarging for better visibility.
3. **List Display**: Simultaneously, display the rest of the Piano Rolls in a vertical list on the right side of the page, similar to how videos are listed on YouTubeâ€™s watch page. Ensure that the list is scrollable if there are more items than can fit on the screen.
4. **Styling**: Apply styling to make the grid and its items visually appealing. Ensure that Piano Rolls are identifiable and have a consistent size across different screen resolutions.

### Part 2: Interactive Selection Tool

Give the user a possibility to select a fragment of the visible Piano Roll. Here's reference layout:

```
+-----------+-------------+---------+  +--------------+
|           |             |         |  |              |
|           |             |         |  |  Piano Roll  |
|           |             |         |  |              |
|           |             |         |  +--------------+
|           |             |         |  +--------------+
|           |             |         |  |              |
|           x1            x2        |  |  Piano Roll  |
+-----------+-------------+---------+  |              |
                                       +--------------+
                                             ...
```

Your task is to implement a tool or an overlay on the piano roll that allows users to click and drag to select a range. The tool should be able to:

1. **Start Selection**: Initiate a selection when the user clicks on a point.
2. **Show Visual Feedback**: Provide real-time visual feedback as the user drags to extend the selection.
3. **Capture Selection Data**: Once a selection is made, capture the data regarding the start and end points of the selection. It's enough to `console.log` the selection. Bonus points if you can get the number of notes within the selection.
4. **Visual Representation of Selection**: Ensure that the selected range is clearly represented on the piano roll. You could change the color, add a border, or use any other visual cue to show the selection.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
